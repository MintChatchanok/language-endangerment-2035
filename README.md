# Project Description
This project investigates the global risk of language extinction using machine learning. I analyze endangered languages worldwide to:
- Classify languages by their endangerment level
- Predict at-risk regions based on language loss trends
- Forecast how many languages will be lost by 2035 in each country
- My models uncover patterns that may guide future preservation strategies.

# Key Results
| Task           | Best Model            | F1 / RÂ²   | Notes                                                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Classification | XGBoost               | F1 = 0.66 | Best at detecting critical categories (Extinct, Critically Endangered) |
| Regression     | Blended CatBoost + RF | RÂ² = 0.04 | Generalization was limited due to sparse features                      |
| Forecasting    | Bootstrap simulation  | ðŸ“‰        | Brazil, India, and Mexico may lose 15â€“17 languages each                |

# Objectives
- Classify languages based on endangerment severity
- Predict endangered language counts per country
- Forecast global risk zones from 2025â€“2035

# Methodology Overview
- Data Source: Kaggleâ€™s Endangered Languages Dataset
- Cleaning & Feature Engineering: Label simplification, continent tags
- Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network, CatBoost
- Visualization: Choropleth mapping, regional risk summaries
- Forecasting: Bootstrapped time-proxy simulation (3 generations â‰ˆ 75 years)

# Insights
- Asia and Africa have the highest total endangered languages
- Oceania and North America are critically vulnerable
- Brazil, India, and Mexico are projected hotspots for language extinction
